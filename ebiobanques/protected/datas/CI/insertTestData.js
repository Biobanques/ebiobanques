Such procedures weredeveloped in several projects including a European project, HELENA, where the Lille University HospitalBiobank managed the overall movements of biological samples across 10 European countries.From a scientific point of view, the Lille University Hospital Biobank developed activities in variousfields including cardiovascular pathology, neurosciences, metabolism\/nutrition and inflammatory boweldiseases both in adult and children. These activities lead to the publication of more than 60 originalpapers in high impact journals.

The platform offers a new organization in the management of biological resources that meets both the clinical requirements and the needs of research programs initiated by the medical community of HEGP. Since its creation the PRB-HEGP is engaged in a quality assurance process in order to qualify for certification to standard PRB NF S96-900 for the first half of 2012. First step in this process was a new definition of the responsibilities of the different actors on the samples (clinicians, surgeons, pathologists, operating room personnel, nurses, PRB staff) and new procedures to optimize circuits, reduce the time from collection to freezing of samples and ensure their traceability. The treatment and storage operations and provision of samples are made according to defined and validated procedures and operating modes. The technical staff who ensure the preparation and freezing of samples is trained in quality practices. A sample management software (Biobase 2) allows to trace all operations performed on the samples and to record the associated annotations. The software enables a unique and anonymized identification of each sample by cryogenic labels barcode. Securing storage conditions are provided by the Thermo-control system which ensures the traceability of temperatures and generates alarms in case of malfunction.
